# Titanic-EDA

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), leveraging Python's powerful data science ecosystem to uncover initial insights, identify patterns, and check assumptions within a given dataset.

Project Objective - The primary objective is to thoroughly explore the dataset through a blend of statistical summaries and robust data visualizations, laying the critical groundwork for subsequent predictive modeling or business decision-making.

Key Deliverables & Activities -
Statistical Summarization: Utilizing Pandas methods like .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to understand data distributions, identify missing values, and analyze categorical variable frequencies.
Data Visualization: Employing Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a comprehensive suite of visualizations, including:
Histograms and Boxplots for examining the shape and spread of individual features and detecting outliers.
Scatterplots to investigate relationships between pairs of variables.
Pair Plots (sns.pairplot) for high-level multivariate relationship visualization.
Heatmaps (sns.heatmap) for clear visualization of correlation matrices.
Insight Generation: Identifying key relationships, trends, anomalies, and dependencies within the data, with detailed observations written for each visual and a summary of overall findings.
Professional Reporting: Production of a Jupyter Notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations, accompanied by a formal PDF report of findings.
